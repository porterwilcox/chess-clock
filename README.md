Chess Clock <br>
  This app is for keeping track of player's times during blitz and bullet chess matches. 
  
The problem as of 7.23 <br>
  It works just fine on codepen.io where I built it originally.  Check it out at https://codepen.io/PorterClimbs/pen/QBKaZX.  Now that I've uploaded the code to git, however, in hopes of getting the app on it's own url the javascript is returning errors.  I was able to resolve the first two that dealt with variables, but now the error is on my first addEventListener and I'm not sure what is wrong with it.  Please, inspect and offer some hints as to where I might look or start to fix the js and getting the chess clock to run again.  Thanks!
